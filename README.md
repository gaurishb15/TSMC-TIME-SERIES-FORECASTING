# TSMC Revenue Forecasting using Time Series Analysis

## Description

This repository contains the code, datasets, plots, and final report for the project **"TSMC Revenue Forecasting using Time Series Analysis."** The objective of this project is to analyze the monthly revenue of the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and compare the forecasting performance of three different time series models: **SARIMA, Holt-Winters, and FB Prophet**. By selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics, this project aims to provide an accurate revenue forecast for the next quarter.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **Code**: Contains the R scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, cross-validation, and revenue forecasting.

- **Datasets**: Holds the dataset used for analysis, which includes monthly revenue data of TSMC. The data, obtained from [TSMC's official website](https://www.tsmc.com), is stored in both `.RData` and `.CSV` formats.

- **Plots**: Includes visualizations generated during the analysis, such as revenue trends, model performance evaluation, and forecasted revenue for the upcoming quarter. These plots help illustrate trends, seasonality, and model accuracy.

- **Final Report**: Summarizes the project objectives, methodology, data analysis process, evaluation metrics, results, and conclusions. It also discusses the strengths and limitations of each model and provides insights for future research and applications.
